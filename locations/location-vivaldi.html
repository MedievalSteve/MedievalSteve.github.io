            <p>Vivaldi is a harsh, desert world where the Class C downport provides a small refuge from the dusty, dry, and windy conditions that dominate the planet's surface. While officially part of the Diadem Main, Vivaldi has developed a reputation as a place where certain goods and services can be obtained that might be difficult to find elsewhere.</p>

              <h3>Environmental Conditions</h3>
              <p>Vivaldi's surface is characterized by vast expanses of dusty, arid terrain buffeted by strong winds. The harsh climate makes the downport facility a crucial lifeline for any visitors to the world, providing shelter from the elements and basic amenities for starship operations.</p>

              <h3>Trade and Commerce</h3>
              <p>While the world maintains official trade relations within the Diadem Main, there are individuals willing to deal in goods that might be considered 'illegal' or restricted elsewhere. These traders can be difficult to locate and may require significant time to arrange meetings at the downport facility. The harsh environment and limited law enforcement presence make Vivaldi attractive to those seeking to conduct business away from prying eyes.</p>

            <div class="location-info">
              <h3>Strategic Considerations</h3>
              <p>For travelers seeking specific goods or services that might not be readily available on more regulated worlds, Vivaldi offers opportunities - though patience and discretion are essential. The world's isolation and harsh conditions provide natural protection for those who prefer to operate outside normal channels.</p>
