            <p>The Nest is the primary hideout of the Void Vultures pirate gang, located in the Yavakrbi sub-sector. This large, older ex-military derelict ship serves as their base of operations and is currently undergoing a major refit to accommodate the Nova Core device.</p>

              <h3>The Station</h3>
              <p>The Nest is a large, older ex-military derelict ship that has been converted into a pirate base. The station is currently undergoing a major refit, with the pirates working to integrate the Nova Core device into its systems. This refit requires specific Imperial Navy-grade components, including K-73H series coolant and Mark IV Naval spec fusion containment coils.</p>

            <div class="location-info">
              <h3>Technical Issues</h3>
              <p>The station's systems are showing signs of strain, with reports of the "old girl" being "thirsty and her heart running hot." The pirates are desperately seeking high-grade military components to complete the refit and stabilize the Nova Core integration. The technical crew, led by figures like Silas Thorne, are working around the clock to keep the station operational.</p>

            <div class="location-info">
              <h3>Strategic Location</h3>
              <p>The Nest is positioned near "The Murk," a local anomaly cluster designation (AZ-203-Delta) that serves as both protection and hazard. The asteroid field and derelict graveyard surrounding the station is prone to sensor anomalies and "sensor ghosts," making it difficult for authorities to locate and approach the pirate base.</p>

              <h3>Pirate Operations</h3>
              <p>The Void Vultures use The Nest as their primary base for coordinating raids, storing loot, and conducting the complex logistics required for their operations. The station houses their leadership, including Captain Roric "Ironjaw" Vayne, and serves as a hub for their criminal activities throughout the Vanguard Reaches.</p>
