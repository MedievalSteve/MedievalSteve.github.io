            <p>Damrong is a paradox: an idyllic, Earth-like garden world with a technologically backward society that is paradoxically bound by a highly structured and restrictive government. It is a moon orbiting a massive gas giant, creating breathtaking skyscapes. The world's tiny population lives in a state of deliberate simplicity, exporting small amounts of high-quality agricultural goods to worlds like Tiffanye in exchange for the technology they cannot produce themselves. It is the perfect place for an organization like the IGS to study something in isolation, and the perfect place for a secret to remain hidden.</p>

              <h3>At a Glance</h3>
              <p>Damrong is a paradox: an idyllic, Earth-like garden world with a technologically backward society that is paradoxically bound by a highly structured and restrictive government. It is a moon orbiting a massive gas giant, creating breathtaking skyscapes. The world's tiny population lives in a state of deliberate simplicity, exporting small amounts of high-quality agricultural goods to worlds like Tiffanye in exchange for the technology they cannot produce themselves. It is the perfect place for an organization like the IGS to study something in isolation, and the perfect place for a secret to remain hidden.</p>

              <h3>The View from Orbit</h3>
              <h4>A Terrestrial Moon</h4>
              <p>From orbit, Damrong is a stunning blue-and-white marble, a near-perfect twin of ancient Terra. Its Size 8 and 70% hydrographics mean vast oceans and large, green continents are clearly visible.</p>
              
              <h4>The Gas Giant "Jove's Eye"</h4>
              <p>Damrong is not a planet, but a moon. It orbits a colossal, rust-coloured gas giant that dominates the sky. This parent world, nicknamed "Jove's Eye" by spacers for a prominent cyclonic storm, provides a constant and spectacular backdrop, its swirling cloud bands and faint rings visible even during the day.</p>
              
              <h4>Binary Suns</h4>
              <p>The system's primary is a bright, orange K-class star that gives the light a warm, golden hue. Far more distant is its companion, a tiny, dim M-class red dwarf that is only visible as a faint, ruddy star during the deepest parts of the night.</p>

            <div class="location-info">
              <h3>On the Surface</h3>
              <h4>A Garden World (Ga)</h4>
              <p>The environment is lush, fertile, and largely untamed. Think vast, ancient forests, sprawling grasslands teeming with alien flora and fauna, and crystal-clear oceans. The air is clean and the weather is generally mild, making it a comfortable, if wild, place to be.</p>
              
              <h4>Pre-Agricultural & Non-Industrial (Ni)</h4>
              <p>There are no sprawling cities, no factory smoke, and no mega-farms. The 40,000 inhabitants live in small, isolated towns and settlements, practicing small-scale farming and horticulture. The lack of industrialization means the natural beauty of the world is almost entirely unspoiled, but it also means the colonists are completely dependent on off-world technology.</p>
              
              <h4>The IGS Presence (S)</h4>
              <p>The IGS Base Camp Epsilon is a stark anomaly. It's a cluster of prefabricated, high-tech modules that stand in sharp contrast to the rustic, low-tech settlements of the colonists. To the locals, it's a mysterious outpost of a world they can barely comprehend.</p>

              <h3>Society & Culture</h3>
              <h4>The Tiffanye Compact</h4>
              <p>Damrong was settled several generations ago by a group from Tiffanye seeking a utopian, low-technology lifestyle. However, they brought their bureaucratic social structures with them. The government (Gov 8: Civil Service Bureaucracy) is a complex web of committees, regulations, and officials that manages every aspect of colonial life, from trade quotas to land use.</p>
              
              <h4>High Law, Low Tech (LL9, TL5)</h4>
              <p>This is the core contradiction of Damrong. The society has the technological level of 20th-century Earth (combustion engines, radio, early aircraft) but the legal structure of a high-tech, authoritarian state. Law enforcement is ever-present but low-tech, relying on constables and strict community policing rather than advanced surveillance.</p>
              
              <h4>Weapon Laws</h4>
              <p>All manufactured weapons are heavily regulated. While a colonist might have a simple slug-thrower for hunting, carrying advanced weaponry like laser rifles or gauss pistols would attract immediate and serious attention from the local constabulary. The PCs' high-tech gear will make them stand out.</p>
              
              <h4>The People</h4>
              <p>The human colonists are generally hardworking and proud of their simple life, though some of the younger generation may be curious about the wider galaxy. They are likely wary of outsiders who represent the complex, high-tech universe they chose to leave behind.</p>

              <h3>For Travellers</h3>
              <h4>The Starport (D-Class)</h4>
              <p>"Starport" is a generous term. It's little more than a flattened, reinforced landing field of packed earth and a single control tower. There is a small office for the bureaucracy to handle customs and trade paperwork. Unrefined fuel is available, but any significant ship repairs are impossible.</p>
              
              <h4>The Economy (Lt)</h4>
              <p>Anything not made of wood, stone, or simple forged metal has to be imported. This makes high-tech goods incredibly expensive and rare. A simple datapad might be worth a small fortune here. The colonists pay for these imports with their only export: carefully cultivated, high-quality agricultural goods and foodstuffs that are prized on worlds like Tiffanye.</p>

              <h3>IGS Research</h3>
              <p>The work of the IGS exploration base on the habitable moon Damrong investigating ancient stone age ruins has garnered serious scientific results. This research into the world's pre-historic inhabitants has provided valuable insights into early human development and migration patterns in the sector.</p>
