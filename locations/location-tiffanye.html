            <p>Tiffanye is the unlikely, yet undeniable, heart of the Diadem Main. A tiny, airless rockball orbiting a dim red dwarf, its billion-plus inhabitants live in sprawling, interconnected domed cities.

Its shabby starport and slow-moving government hide a vibrant society that punches far above its weight in subsector politics.</p>

              <h3>At a Glance</h3>
              <p>Tiffanye is the unlikely, yet undeniable, heart of the Diadem Main. A tiny, airless rockball orbiting a dim red dwarf, its billion-plus inhabitants live in sprawling, interconnected domed cities. What it lacks in natural resources it makes up for in cultural and intellectual capital. Tiffanye is a world of artists, academics, and bureaucrats, home to the prestigious Tiffanye University System and the headquarters of the crew's patron, the Institute for Geophysical Studies (IGS).

              <h3>The View from Orbit</h3>
              <h4>A Tiny, Pockmarked World</h4>
              <p>Tiffanye is a small, Size 2 rockball, only 3,200 km in diameter. It has no atmosphere or surface water (Atmosphere 0, Hydrographics 0), and its surface is a cratered wasteland, constantly bombarded by debris from a nearby asteroid belt.</p>
              
              <h4>Tidally Locked</h4>
              <p>The world is tidally locked to its dim, M5-class red dwarf star. This means one side of the planet is in perpetual, faint daylight, while the other is in eternal night, lit only by the brilliant starfields of deep space.</p>
              
              <h4>City Lights</h4>
              <p>The most prominent feature from orbit is the web of lights spreading across the surface. These are the massive, interconnected domed cities that house the planet's entire population. The largest of these is the capital, Quentin.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="location-info">
              <h3>On the Surface</h3>
              <h4>Vacuum and Low Gravity (Va)</h4>
              <p>Outside the domes, it's a lethal vacuum. Inside, the cities maintain a breathable atmosphere and comfortable 0.8G gravity, a significant enhancement over the world's natural 0.2G.</p>
              
              <h4>Industrial Scars and Domed Cities (In)</h4>
              <p>The landscape is a testament to its history. The surface is scarred by depleted open-cast mines, many of which have been converted into industrial factory sites or foundations for new city domes. Life is entirely contained within these massive structures, which range from gleaming academic arcologies to grimy industrial complexes.</p>
              
              <h4>The IGS Headquarters (S)</h4>
              <p>The IGS maintains a significant presence here, with its main administrative headquarters and media production studios located in the University district of Quentin. This Exploration Base is the nerve center for all their operations in the Vanguard Reaches.</p>

              <h3>Society & Culture</h3>
              <h4>The Educated Masses (Hi)</h4>
              <p>Tiffanye boasts a massive population of over a billion souls (Population 9). Thanks to a history of social investment and free higher education, this is a highly educated and cultured populace. It is a world renowned for its artists, social scientists, and philosophers.</p>
              
              <h4>The Tiffanye Collective</h4>
              <p>The government (Gov 9: Inflexible Bureaucracy) is a complex, slow-moving machine run by the "Collective Council of Experts." While this system ensures stability and provides a universal basic income, it stifles innovation and makes business dealings a nightmare of red tape. This is the "Tiffanye Tangle" the crew must navigate.</p>
              
              <h4>High Law, High Tech (LL9, TL-A)</h4>
              <p>Law enforcement is ubiquitous and efficient. The world's technology level is TL-10 (A), making it advanced but, as noted, more focused on practical industry and arts than cutting-edge theoretical science. They can build good machinery, but they rely on others for groundbreaking new tech.</p>
              
              <h4>A World of Imports (Na)</h4>
              <p>As a non-agricultural vacuum world, Tiffanye imports 100% of its food and relies heavily on imported raw materials now that its own mines are depleted. This makes it a vital trade hub, but also vulnerable to blockades or trade disputes.</p>

              <h3>For Travellers</h3>
              <h4>The Starport (C-Class)</h4>
              <p>The Quentin Downport is functional but shabby. It can handle repairs and refueling, but it's overcrowded and bogged down by bureaucratic inefficiency. Getting through customs can be an adventure in itself.</p>
              
              <h4>The Economy</h4>
              <p>Tiffanye's economy is driven by its industrial output and, more importantly, its intellectual property. It exports manufactured goods, but its most valuable products are media (like the IGS's documentaries), art, and the expertise of its graduates.</p>
