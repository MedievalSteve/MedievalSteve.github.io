            <p>HSS Squad Leader Valerius was a consummate professional, a product of the Hyperion League's elite corporate security program. Ex-military from an independent world absorbed by the League, he chose a lucrative corporate career over fighting a losing battle.</p>

              <h3>Personality</h3>
              <p>Valerius was driven by a desire for efficiency and a clean record. He despised messy situations and would always seek the path of least resistance to achieve his objective. He was not cruel, but he was pragmatic to a fault; the fate of the IGS scientists was a data point, not a moral concern.</p>

            <div class="npc-info">
              <h3>Tactics</h3>
              <p>Valerius would not open fire unless fired upon. His initial approach was professional intimidation, using his squad's superior numbers and firepower to establish a perimeter and demand compliance. He was open to negotiation, but only if it led to him acquiring the artifact.</p>
