            <p>Quartermaster Valerius ("Val") is the pragmatic logistical chief of The Nest, with ambitions that extend far beyond simple piracy. Val's long-term goal is not to escape the criminal life, but to transform The Nest into a legitimate operation.</p>

              <h3>Appearance</h3>
              <p>Val is sharp, calm, and appraising, with a neat appearance that stands in stark contrast to the station's grime. Their professional demeanor suggests a background in legitimate business or logistics.</p>

            <div class="npc-info">
              <h3>Ambitions</h3>
              <p>Val sees The Nest not as a pirate den, but as a potential legitimate, independent freeport and trade hub in the chaotic Vanguard Reaches. The sale of the Nova Core to the Tyrannus Combine was intended as seed money for this grand ambition. Val plans to use the massive payment to buy political legitimacy from a minor local faction, systematically repair and upgrade The Nest's systems, and oust Vayne and his violent cronies, replacing them with a paid security force.</p>

              <h3>Recent Activities</h3>
              <p>Val assisted the party in securing the Nova Core and escaping the Nest, in return for a promise to turn over 90% of the funds acquired by returning the Ancients device back to the Ghenani (which, in this case, was nothing). Last seen in the vicinity of The Nest.</p>
