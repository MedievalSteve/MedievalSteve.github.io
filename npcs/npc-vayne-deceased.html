              <h3>Leadership Style</h3>
              <p>Vayne was a tactically astute but brutally direct commander, preferring to overwhelm his enemies with focused, aggressive force. This confidence, however, bordered on arrogance, particularly concerning his flagship, the "Void Reaper", which he considered a flawless extension of his own power.</p>

            <div class="npc-info">
              <h3>Personality</h3>
              <p>Beneath his aggressive exterior lay a deep-seated paranoia. He was notoriously distrustful of modern wireless technology and was especially wary of psionics, which he viewed as a tool for spies and assassins. This forced him to rely on older, hard-wired systems for his most sensitive operations.</p>

              <h3>Fate</h3>
              <p>Vayne was killed in a skirmish on his Space Station when a Stun Grenade he was using went off in his hand and he was executed by Lucius Vin Geitenhoven.</p>
