              <h3>Appearance</h3>
              <p>Gristle is a massive, grease-stained man with a cybernetic arm that whirs loudly. He typically sits on a crate, scratching a grimy beard, and eyes visitors with bored avarice.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="npc-info">
              <h3>Personality</h3>
              <p>Gristle is corrupt and opportunistic, using his position as dock master to extract tribute from visiting ships. He's known for his demands for "discretion fees" and threats to file reports with the Enforcers if his demands aren't met.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="npc-info">
              <h3>Typical Demands</h3>
              <p>"Another run for Vayne's little parcel service," he grunts. "Tribute's due. A bottle of something that burns, or a few hundred creds for my 'discretion fund'. Unless you'd rather I file a full 'Unexpected Mass Signature' report with the Enforcers?"</p>
