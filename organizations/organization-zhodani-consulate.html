            <p>Still referred to as the Driantia Steblenzhtia or 'Vanguard Consulate' by most of its inhabitants, the Colonnade Province is more than a Zhodani client state; it is a detached extension of the Zhodani Consulate, complete with Zhodani military bases and other governmental institutions.</p>

              <h3>Historical Development</h3>
              <p>The Colonnade Province evolved from the establishment of the Colonnade Administrative District (CAD) in 576, initially a loose federation to stabilize regions of the Far Frontiers and Vanguard Reaches in response to the arrival of the first colonists from Imperial space. After the First Frontier War, the Zhodani Consulate increased efforts to block potential Imperial expansion by encouraging the colonization of the spinward region of the Vanguard Reaches, leading to the establishment of the Driantia Steblenzhtia in 626.</p>
              <p>While the CAD was a loose federation that welcomed and incorporated immigrants from the Imperium, the Driantia Steblenzhtia – while initially notably tolerant of alternative forms of government and cultural innovations – was not open to immigrants not from the Zhodani Consulate or its client states. Over time, the policies of these two states became more aligned, rejecting non-Zhodani immigration and practices until the two states merged to become the current Colonnade Province in 879.</p>

              <h3>Territory and Demographics</h3>
              <p>Covering 88 systems along the spinward subsectors of the Vanguard Reaches and coreward into the Wulfek subsector of the Far Frontiers, with a few outlying systems further spinward in the Yiklerzdanzh and Chtedria (Fulani) sectors, the Colonnade Province has a population of 45 billion, mostly humans of Zhodani or Vlazhdumecta descent. Descendants of Vilani and Solomani immigrants who arrived prior to 750 account for barely 5% of the population of the Province.</p>
              <p>The Province is essentially a miniature version of the Zhodani Consulate and many residents consider themselves to be Consular citizens, just waiting for the greater Consulate to officially recognize their inclusion in the greater realm.</p>

            <div class="organization-info">
              <h3>Government Structure</h3>
              <p>The region is ruled by its Provincial Council at Nielkladlief, with subsector councils at Chyia Nedlkel, Dlieblafia and Yavakrbi. As within the Consulate, only Nobles have the franchise and only the Nobles and those talented Proles promoted to Intendants are trained to use psionic powers.</p>
              <p>The Province supports its own independent interstellar military forces, although Consular Navy vessels and liaisons often engage in goodwill visits and joint exercises. A Provincial Guard modelled on the Consular Guard focuses on psionically trained troops. A separate branch of the Tavrchedl' reports to the Provincial leadership at Nielkladlief but its practices are identical to those within the Consulate.</p>

            <div class="organization-info">
              <h3>Military and Security</h3>
              <p>The Province is not expansionist and has not fought any wars with its neighbours. Despite its initial purpose as a check on Imperial expansion and the Third Imperium's two attempts to counter that expansion by sponsoring settlements in the Andwella and Trelyn subsectors, neither the Third or Fourth Frontier Wars led to direct conflict between the Colonnade and the Third Imperium's proxies.</p>
              <p>The Province's major military concern is the continued warfare and lawlessness in the Tellerian Cluster and the Provincial Navy's major role is to provide escort support to commercial traffic within the cluster. Major Provincial fleet elements mostly remain within the Province's borders, occasionally engaging in patrols up to 10 parsecs further to show the flag or discourage lawless activity.</p>

            <div class="organization-info">
              <h3>Diplomatic Relations</h3>
              <p>The Colonnade maintains good relations with all other states in the Vanguard Reaches. Close contact with the Murian Altarean Confederation has existed since the earliest days of the CAD. The return of Zhodani citizens after the misjumped Brenchrodl Rits arrived at Elliador has engendered good relations with the Eslyat Magistracy despite the race's sometimes aggressive expansion.</p>
              <p>Although 'Imperials' of Vilani and Solomani descent are no longer welcomed to settle within the Province, the 'Imperial' states, from Telleria to Hyperion, the Diadem and even the Trelyn Domain maintain good relations with the Colonnade. Contact further afield with the Corellan League, Kajaani Triumvirate and Jarnac Pashalic are hampered more by distance than distaste and Triumvirate trade expeditions are regularly welcomed at Yavakrbi.</p>

            <div class="organization-info">
              <h3>Cultural Identity</h3>
              <p>The Colonnade Province has achieved its founding goals to spread Zhodani civilisation to the steblenzhtia or 'vanguard' region and block further Imperial expansion to spinward. Its citizens mostly look forward to the day when the Consulate recognizes them as full members of Humaniti's oldest interstellar state.</p>
              <p>Early Zhodani and Vlazhdumecta settlers had occupied scattered worlds in the spinward regions of the Vanguard Reaches and Far Frontiers for thousands of years. The earliest well-document settlement in the Vanguard Reaches is at Zdodren – now Chyia Nedlkel – settled by Vlazhdumecta prospectors in -2950.</p>
