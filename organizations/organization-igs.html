            <p>The preeminent scientific organisation in the Vanguard Reaches is the Institute for Geophysical Studies (IGS) of Tiffanye, which sponsors archaeological, anthropological and xenopological expeditions and planetary exploration by leading scientists, lay organisations and wealthy patrons. Founded in 924, the IGS is the most famous institution linked to Tiffanye. It is a private, member supported organisation funded by donations, grants and subscriptions and fees generated by its media empire, including science and exploration-themed series and several showcase museums on Tiffanye.</p>

              <h3>Operations and Structure</h3>
              <p>IGS operations are part science, part education and part entertainment. The organisation maintains a staff of both science and media personalities, and has a fleet of exploratory vessels engaging in expeditions, mostly within the Vanguard Reaches but some ranging 50 or more parsecs from Tiffanye. Some of these expeditions are research focused, others more guided tours for wealthy patrons and more are media vehicles in support of series or specials.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="organization-info">
              <h3>Research Focus</h3>
              <p>Much of the IGS's work focuses on softer sciences, including descriptive xenology and sophontology but serious work in physical and life sciences occurs on some focused expeditions. The organization specializes in:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Archaeological Research:</strong> Investigation of ancient civilizations and artifacts</li>
                <li><strong>Anthropological Studies:</strong> Study of human cultures and societies</li>
                <li><strong>Xenopological Research:</strong> Analysis of alien species and civilizations</li>
                <li><strong>Planetary Exploration:</strong> Survey and documentation of new worlds</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Sciences:</strong> Geological and atmospheric studies</li>
                <li><strong>Life Sciences:</strong> Biological research and ecological studies</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="organization-info">
              <h3>Notable Expeditions</h3>
              <p>The IGS has conducted numerous significant expeditions throughout its history:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Goblin's Planet Expedition:</strong> While the abortive IGS expedition to Goblin's Planet in The Beyond might be more famous, it represents the organization's willingness to explore dangerous frontiers</li>
                <li><strong>Damrong Research Base:</strong> The work of the IGS exploration base on the habitable moon Damrong investigating ancient stone age ruins has garnered serious scientific results</li>
                <li><strong>Vanguard Reaches Surveys:</strong> Extensive mapping and documentation of the sector's diverse worlds and cultures</li>
                <li><strong>Long-Range Expeditions:</strong> Missions ranging 50 or more parsecs from Tiffanye to explore distant regions</li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Science Series:</strong> Educational programming focused on scientific discoveries and exploration</li>
                <li><strong>Exploration Documentaries:</strong> Real-time coverage of expeditions and discoveries</li>
                <li><strong>Showcase Museums:</strong> Several museums on Tiffanye displaying artifacts and research findings</li>
                <li><strong>Educational Content:</strong> Materials for academic institutions and public education</li>
                <li><strong>Commercial Licensing:</strong> Sale of media content to broadcasters and educational organizations</li>

              <h3>Fleet and Equipment</h3>
              <p>The Baixing-built IGS fleet includes a few large Discovery vessels but most of its starships are variations of the 400-ton Explorer science vessel, capable of supporting 20 people on an extended expedition and equipped with a runabout for short-term investigations.</p>

            <div class="organization-info">
              <h3>Political Controversies</h3>
              <p>The IGS has faced political challenges and accusations from various factions:</p>

                <li><strong>Tellerian Cluster Incidents:</strong> IGS vessels in the Tellerian Cluster have come under fire from multiple factions</li>
                <li><strong>Eli Hostage Crisis:</strong> In 1099, the Eli held one ship's crew hostage, highlighting the dangers of exploration</li>
                <li><strong>Official Denials:</strong> Tiffanye's Collective denies funding more than specific scientific research projects and providing a basic stipend available to all qualified non-governmental agencies</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="organization-info">
