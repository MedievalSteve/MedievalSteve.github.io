        <p>The tundra world of Nielkladlief technically qualifies as a garden world but its average surface temperature is -2°C, with ice covering half of the planet's surface area. Since 996 Nielkladlief has been the capital of the entire Zhodani Consulate Colonnade Province, serving as the administrative centre of the 88 Colonnade systems.</p>

        <p>Nielkladlief orbits a pair of main sequence stars, a yellow-white F9-type and an orange-red M0-type separated by up to 0.6 AU during their 170 day orbit. Each of these stars has three rocky worlds in tight orbits and the brighter has an asteroid belt beyond those worlds that acts as a source of unstable orbit-cross hazards. Nielkladlief is the innermost of the worlds orbiting both stars, averaging 1.6 AU from the pair's barycentre and orbiting just outside a sparse rocky asteroid field.</p>

        <p>Located at the edge of the habitable zone, only volcanic activity and a long summer with associated melts keeps the planet from undergoing a runaway icehouse. Nielkladlief's southern hemisphere is more moderate than the north, with the summer season of the 610 standard day year coinciding with furthest separation from the two stars – although the binary components' orbit complicates the swing of seasons considerably. The net result is a region between the equator and edge of the southern tropics at 15° south that remains above freezing throughout most of the year.</p>

        <p>First settled as a mining colony in 630, Nielkladlief grew as a recreation centre for the local belter community and other spacers, with 'winter' sports and hiking available near the downport most of the year. A compatible ecosystem allowed the development of an agricultural industry to feed the spacers and a shipyard capable of repairing their ships followed. Simple regulations allowed the world to prosper. Situated at the coreward end of the Dlieblafia Main, the world became a resupply point for settlers, traders and explorers heading rimward and, from many a ship passing through, some decided to stay behind on the pleasant world.</p>

        <p>By 804, Nielkladlief had a population in the millions and the beginnings of a local ore processing industry in orbit. In that year, a 20-kilometre diameter rock dubbed The Big One was perturbed out of its orbit around Tlobre, the brighter of Nielkladlief's two stars, and set to impact Nielkladlief within two years. The local population of spacers scrambled to divert the massive asteroid before it could wreck Nielkladlief's ecosystem for millennia to come. Their solution was to install thrusters and mass drivers on the asteroid, changing its orbit so it would miss its target. In 806, The Big One passed within 3,000 kilometres of Nielkladlief's surface on an altered course. When it passed near Nielkladlief again five years later, additional thrusters placed it into orbit. The Big One, renamed Drienshfleldria, after a mythical sky palace, became Nielkladlief's moon and evolved into its orbital port and the Colonnade Province's largest shipyard.</p>

        <p>In 996, with expansion across the region complete, Nielkladlief became the new capital of the Colonnade Province, its administrative offices the centrepiece of the purpose-built capital of Izdona, a city set in a valley near some of the best ski slopes and hiking trails on the planet. The world government has tried to control development in subtle ways, rewarding density and discouraging surface roads. Benefiting from an uninterrupted legacy of high technology, nearly all transport on Nielkladlief is via grav vehicle. Tall cities concentrate the population in two dozen urban zones, which remain near wilderness areas. While those seeking warm beaches must look elsewhere, Nielkladlief remains a tourist destination for those who value leisure in a cooler clime. Those who truly want an oceanfront holiday can at least take solace in the installation of the Province's biggest wave machine deep within a warm chamber with holographic skies.</p>

        <p>Drenalch is a rich, agricultural world with improving living conditions due to a bustling agro-economy. As an agricultural world, it provides a near-ideal environment for producing quality foodstuffs of plant, animal, and other forms, making these a major export commodity. The world boasts a prosperous and thriving economy, with high-grade living conditions, a good climate, and a non-harmful environment, making immigration registration highly sought after.</p>

        <p>The planet is thought to be a small gas giant core terraformed by the Ancients more than 300,000 years ago. Land is concentrated in one globe-spanning equatorial supercontinent, with northern and southern deep oceans covering 81% of the planetary surface area. The habitable area is primarily limited to Gureana, a protected semi-circular gulf more than 2,000 kilometres across that appears to be a basin excavated by an intentional asteroid impact during the Ancients' terraforming effort.</p>

        <p>The Ghenani, the native human Minor Race, have adapted to the planet's unique conditions. Their physiology reflects the high gravity and dense atmosphere, with muscular builds and short legs that lower their center of gravity against strong winds. The lack of ultraviolet radiation has resulted in pale skin and fair eyes, with albinism affecting more than 10% of the population. The warm climate has led to their characteristic lack of head or body hair, with minimal clothing typically consisting of loincloths or skirts accented by tool belts or bandoliers.</p>

        <p>Ghenani civilization arose in the Gureana Basin and remains generally limited to the basin and mountain mining settlements at its periphery. The rugged mountains, interior deserts, and coastal regions prone to devastating storms have naturally constrained their development to these more hospitable areas.</p>
