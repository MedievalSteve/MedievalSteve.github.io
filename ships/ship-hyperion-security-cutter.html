            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The Hyperion Lines Security Cutter is a corporate security vessel designed for asset protection and recovery operations. While most details about this ship remain classified by Hyperion Lines, what is known suggests a vessel built for corporate enforcement rather than military engagement.</p>

            <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
            <p>The semi-streamlined configuration suggests a vessel optimized for space operations with limited atmospheric landing capability. This design choice likely prioritizes internal volume and operational systems over the ability to perform high-performance atmospheric maneuvers. The modest thrust rating indicates the ship relies more on positioning and firepower than speed and agility.</p>

            <h3>Intelligence Assessment</h3>
            <p>Much about the Hyperion Security Cutter's capabilities remains unknown. Armament, sensor capabilities, crew complement, and jump range are all classified by Hyperion Lines. Travelers encountering these vessels should proceed with extreme caution and assume they are well-armed and professionally crewed.</p>
